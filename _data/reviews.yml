      One of the spacious and very big banquet and lawn(approx 8000sqft ) First time in Dum Dum road, best thing is that it
                        was fully in ground floor very good for senior citizens how can't walk on stairs. And we know that parents get
                        much tired to manage the guest from one floor to another but here the best thing is that the parents can fully cordinate
                        and manage the guests because everything is in ground floor and last not the least very important is the parking Melabagan
                        banquet have their own parking area...

                        Thank you
                        To the owner of
                        Melabagan banquet

                        For providing us such a beautiful and spacious banquet in Dum Dum road
